### What is ACM Design? ###

UCLA ACMâ€™s primary goal is to serve the UCLA CS and tech community. As our community grew in size, so did our need for a unified visual identity. We saw there was a large opportunity to make UCLA ACM more accessible, and communicate our mission better. 


In response, ACM Design was created. We are an internal committee inside ACM that supports the rest of our organization by unifying and maintaining our branding.


### What's this website for? ###
We've creaed a collection of resources and assets for the entirety of ACM to use, so we can spend less time on locating where a logo PNG is, and more time on preparing events and workshops.
