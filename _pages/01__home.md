<h1>Communicating Tech for People</h1>

<h3>What is ACM Design?</h3>
<p>
UCLA ACMâ€™s primary goal is to serve the UCLA CS and tech community. As our community grew in size, so did our need for a unified visual identity. We saw there was a large opportunity to make UCLA ACM more accessible, and communicate our mission better. 
</p>
<p>
In response, ACM Design was created. We are an internal committee inside ACM that supports the rest of our organization by unifying and maintaining our branding.
</p>

<h3>What's this website for?</h3>
<p>We've creaed a collection of resources and assets for the entirety of ACM to use, so we can spend less time on locating where a logo PNG is, and more time on preparing events and workshops.</p>
